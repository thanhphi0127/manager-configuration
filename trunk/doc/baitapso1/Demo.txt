TortoiseSVN is free software for software developers (programmers). It helps programmers manage different versions of the source code for their programs.
Tortoise SVN is a Subversion client, implemented as a Microsoft Windows shell extension. It is released under the GNU General Public License.
In Windows Explorer, besides showing context menu items for Subversion commands, it also provides icon overlay that indicates the status of Subversion working copies.
