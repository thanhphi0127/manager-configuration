TortoiseSVN is free software for software developers (programmers). It helps programmers manage different versions of the source code for their programs.
Tortoise SVN is a Subversion client, implemented as a Microsoft Windows shell extension. It is released under the GNU General Public License.
In Windows Explorer, besides showing context menu items for Subversion commands, it also provides icon overlay that indicates the status of Subversion working copies.
TortoiseSVN won the SourceForge.net 2007 Community Choice Award for Best Tool or Utility for Developers.[3] The TortoiseMerge utility comes with the TortoiseSVN distribution to visually compare differences between two files.[4] It is available from the Tigris.org website.
TortoiseSVN can be integrated into Microsoft Visual Studio by using a third-party plugin such as VisualSVN,[5] VsTortoise, and AnkhSVN. A third-party repository monitoring application using TortoiseSVN was named SVN-Monitor, and then evolved into Vercue in 2011.[6]
